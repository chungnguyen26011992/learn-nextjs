# What is Nextjs
- Framework for creating pre-rendered React websites
- Offers us both Server Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)

Nextjs it's a react framework that allows us to create pre-rendered react websites whether that be via server-side rendering or static site generation. Server-side rendering is when react components are rendered into html pages on the server after a page request comes from the browser and static site generation is when components are rendered into html pages at build time so that we can just deploy the web pages and javascript bundles to the web and nextjs allows us to easily do both of these things meaning that our react components are already rendered into html pages by the time they reach the browser now from that point onwards the application can behave more like an spa a single page application in the all routing can be handled on the client side in the browser now in contrast to this without next react renders components in the browser instead and this is known as client-side rendering. Now the benefits of server-side rendering and static site generation are that firstly it can improve a website's performance because components are pre-rendered meaning less work in the browser and secondly it results in better seo than traditional single page applications because the response from the server is a fully rendered html page rather than just a blank one which is what would be returned in a regular react application without next so in the eyes of search engine crawlers it makes our site much more palatable.

## SSG & SSR Benefits
- Pre-rendering improves performance
- Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
